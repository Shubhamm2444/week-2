* Example Usage in HTML (using Create React App):

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html lang="en">
<head>
    <meta charset="UTF-8">
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0">
    <title>My React App</title>
</head>
<body>
    <div id="root"></div>
    <script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/react.development.js"></script>
    <script src="%PUBLIC_URL%/index.js"></script>
</body>
</html>


//Explanation:
This HTML file (index.html) has a div element with the ID root.
React components (like Greeting) are rendered within this div using Create React App's ReactDOM.render method in your JavaScript code (index.js).

# By creating and using reusable React components, you can effectively build complex user interfaces for your web applications.
