This example builds upon the Express.js code:

JavaScript
const express = require('express');
const app = express();

// ... (Express.js routes and middleware)

// Example: Serve static files from a "public" directory
app.use(express.static('public'));

// ... (other server-side logic)

app.listen(3000, () => {
  console.log('Server listening on port 3000');
});

//These are just basic examples, but they demonstrate how each technology is used in MERN stack development. Remember to install the necessary packages for each technology (e.g., mongodb for the MongoDB driver) before running the code.
