Adding Your First Component: A To-Do List in React
Here's a step-by-step guide to create a basic to-do list application using React components:

1. Project Setup (Assuming you have Node.js and npm installed):
Open your terminal or command prompt.
Create a new directory for your project: mkdir my-to-do-app and navigate into it: cd my-to-do-app.
Initialize a new React project using Create React App: npx create-react-app . (This creates the project structure and installs dependencies).

2. Creating the To-Do List Component (ToDoList.js):
Inside the src directory, create a new file named ToDoList.js.
Add the following code to define a functional React component named ToDoList:


3:Features of this To-Do List:
Users can add new tasks.
Users can toggle the completion status of tasks.
Users can remove completed or unwanted tasks.

4:Further Enhancement Ideas:
Implement persistence to save to-do items even after refreshing the page (using local storage or a database).
Add a filter to show only completed or incomplete tasks.

5:Incorporate editing existing tasks.
This is a basic example to get you started with React components for building interactive user interfaces. You can customize and extend this to-do list app to explore other features and functionalities.
