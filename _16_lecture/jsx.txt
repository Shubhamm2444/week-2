Example of JSX in a React Component:

import React from 'react';

function HelloMessage(props) {
  const name = 'Alice'; // Assuming a name variable

  return (
    <div>
      <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1>
      <p>Welcome to React!</p>
    </div>
  );
}

export default HelloMessage;

//Explanation:
This code defines a React component called HelloMessage.
It uses JSX within the return statement to create the UI structure.
The <h1>Hello, {name}!</h1> line demonstrates how an expression ({name}) is evaluated within curly braces and its value is interpolated into the string.
The entire JSX code is translated into JavaScript function calls during compilation. React uses this information to render the UI.
