# Creating Functional Components in React with JSX, JS, and CSS
Functional components are the fundamental building blocks of user interfaces (UIs) in React applications. They are reusable units of code written in JavaScript that define how a part of your UI should look and behave. Here's a breakdown of creating functional components using JSX (JavaScript XML), JavaScript, and CSS:

1: JSX (JavaScript XML):
JSX allows you to write HTML-like structures within your JavaScript code.
It's a syntactic sugar that gets transformed into regular JavaScript function calls during compilation.
JSX provides a familiar and intuitive way to define the UI structure within your components.

2: JavaScript (JS):
Functional components are typically defined as JavaScript functions.
These functions take optional arguments called "props" (properties) that can be passed from parent components to customize the functionality or appearance.
Within the function, you can use JSX to define the UI structure and logic related to the component.
You might also use JavaScript for state management (using the useState hook) or event handling (using event handlers like onClick).

3: CSS:
CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) is used to style the visual appearance of your React components.
You can create separate CSS files to define styles for your components.
You can use selectors (e.g., class names or element types) in your CSS to target specific elements within your JSX code.
Alternatively, you can apply inline styles directly within your JSX using the style attribute (less preferred for larger projects).

4: Key Points:
Functional components are reusable and stateless.
JSX provides a convenient way to structure your UI.
CSS helps style the visual elements.
Separate your styling code (CSS) for better maintainability.
By effectively combining JSX, JavaScript (including state and event handling), and CSS, you can create engaging and interactive UIs using React functional components.
